# MovieManager

This app is modeled on a popular website about movies and actors. 
Home page displays upcoming premieres and top rated movies. 
The "Movies" tab displays the movie database. In this tab, the user can sort, filter movies and choose the number of movies displayed on the site. When any movie is selected, the movie details will be displayed. Logged in user can add and edit his reviews for the movie or rate the cast. 
The "Actors" tab displays the actors database. The user can filter the actors (gender, rating, nationality, year of birth), sort (alphabetically, rating, number of ratings, year of birth) and select the number of actors displayed on the page. After selecting an actor, its details are displayed. Logged in users can rate the actor's performance in the movies he/she played.

The application provides users with two roles: Moderator and Admin. The Moderator can add new movies, actors and edit them. Admin can manage roles, add and edit movies or actors and also can edit or delete reviews.
